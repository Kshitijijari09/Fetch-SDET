# Running the Fake Gold Bar Detection Script
This guide explains how to clone and run the Fake Gold Bar Detection project from GitHub. Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine and execute the script.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local system:

* Git: Needed to clone the repository.
* Python: Version 3.6 or higher, which is required to run the script.
* Selenium WebDriver: The Selenium library for Python.
* ChromeDriver: WebDriver for Google Chrome, compatible with your version of the browser.
* Installing Git
* If Git is not already installed on your machine, you can download and install it from https://git-scm.com/downloads.

### Installing Python
Python can be downloaded and installed from https://www.python.org/downloads/. Ensure that Python is correctly added to your system's PATH.

### Installing Selenium
Once Python is installed, you can install Selenium using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install selenium
Installing ChromeDriver
Download ChromeDriver from the following URL, matching the version with your Chrome browser: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads. Ensure ChromeDriver is placed in a directory included in your system's PATH, or you can specify its path directly in the scripts.

## Cloning the Repository
To clone the repository and set up the project, follow these steps:

Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
Clone the repository using the following command:
#### bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Kshitijijari09/Fetch-SDET.git
Replace your-username and your-repository-name with your actual GitHub username and the name of the repository.
Navigate into the project directory:
#### bash
Copy code
cd Fetch_SDET
Running the Script
To run the main script, execute the following command from the root of the project directory:

#### bash
Copy code
python main.py
This command will start the Selenium WebDriver, open the specified website, and perform the automated tests to identify the fake gold bar.

### Additional Notes
Ensure that the URL and the elements' IDs in the scripts match those on the target website.
Adjust the sleep times in the script if necessary to accommodate network speed or response times of the website.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while running the script:

Verify that ChromeDriver is correctly installed and accessible.
Ensure that all Python packages are installed and up to date.
Check the website URL and ensure that the web elements the script interacts with are present and correctly identified.
